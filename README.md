Flightgear Airport/Scenery OLBIA COSTA SMERALDA (LIEO)


Olbia Costa Smeralda is a nice airport in northern Sardinia. It is placed at the center of the western Mediterranean, in the wonderful Costa Smeralda, and is one of the most crowded airport in Sardinia (more than 2,5 million pax/year, growing 10%/year). It is connected with a great number of airports in Europe and a lot of airlines flight there. The airport hosts a very nice terminal for general aviation and, particularly during Summer, the dedicated Apron 2 is crowded with executive-jets and BBJ.
